To access your home server running Ubuntu over the internet, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up SSH on Your Home Server
1. **Install SSH Server**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openssh-server
   ```

2. **Enable and Start SSH Service**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable ssh
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   ```

3. **Check SSH Status**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status ssh
   ```

### 2. Configure Your Router
1. **Port Forwarding**:
   - Log in to your router's web interface.
   - Find the port forwarding section.
   - Add a new port forwarding rule to forward external port 22 to the internal IP address of your Ubuntu server on port 22.

2. **Dynamic DNS (Optional)**:
   - If your external IP address changes frequently, set up a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service to get a consistent hostname that maps to your dynamic IP. Many routers support DDNS services like No-IP or DynDNS.

### 3. Secure Your SSH Server
1. **Change the Default Port (Optional)**:
   - Edit the SSH configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```
   - Change the line `#Port 22` to another port number, e.g., `Port 2222`.
   - Restart SSH service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart ssh
     ```

2. **Disable Root Login**:
   - In the same SSH configuration file, find and change the line `PermitRootLogin` to `no`.
   - Restart SSH service.

3. **Use Public Key Authentication**:
   - Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen
     ```
   - Copy the public key to your server:
     ```bash
     ssh-copy-id username@server_ip
     ```

4. **Disable Password Authentication** (after setting up key-based authentication):
   - In the SSH configuration file, set `PasswordAuthentication` to `no`.
   - Restart SSH service.

### 4. Access Your Server Remotely
- Open an SSH connection from a remote machine using the command:
  ```bash
  ssh -p [port] username@your_external_ip_or_ddns_hostname
  ```
  Replace `[port]` with your chosen port if you changed it from the default, `username` with your server username, and `your_external_ip_or_ddns_hostname` with your external IP or DDNS hostname.

### 5. Additional Tips
1. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Ensure your server's firewall allows SSH traffic:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow ssh
     ```

2. **Regularly Update Your System**:
   - Keep your server updated to protect against vulnerabilities:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt upgrade
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to securely access your Ubuntu home server over the internet using SSH.
