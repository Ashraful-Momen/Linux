make a command for xamp alternative for this command => sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run


If running sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run directly starts XAMPP for you, we can create a simple Bash script and then make it executable. Here's how you can do it:

    Create a Bash script file, let's name it xamp, in a directory that is included in your system's PATH. For example, you can create it in /usr/local/bin, which is a common directory for user-installed executables.

bash

sudo nano /usr/local/bin/xamp

    In the text editor, add the following lines to the file:

bash

#!/bin/bash
sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run

    Save the file and exit the text editor.

    Make the script executable:

bash

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/xamp

Now, you should be able to start XAMPP by simply typing xamp in your terminal, and it will execute sudo /opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run behind the scenes.
>>> sudo xamp


=========================================================================================================================================================
It seems there was an issue with the modifications you made in your .bashrc file. Specifically, there's an error in one of the lines you added. Let's correct it.

Replace this line:

bash

alias xamp='/opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run'

with:

bash

alias xamp='/opt/lampp/manager-linux-x64.run'

It seems like you've attempted to add the alias for xamp correctly, but perhaps there's some confusion caused by a previous error message. After correcting this line, save the file and then source it again:

bash

source ~/.bashrc

Now, you should be able to start XAMPP by typing xamp in your terminal.
