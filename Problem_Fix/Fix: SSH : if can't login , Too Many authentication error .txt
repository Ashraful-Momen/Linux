The error indicates that the host key for 36.255.68.213 has changed. This could be due to legitimate reasons (e.g., the server was reinstalled, or its SSH configuration changed) or a security concern (like a man-in-the-middle attack).

To fix the issue:
Steps:

    Remove the offending key: Run the following command to remove the outdated or conflicting key from your known_hosts file:

ssh-keygen -f "/home/ashraful/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "36.255.68.213"

Reconnect to the server: Attempt to connect again:

ssh root@36.255.68.213

You will be prompted to verify and accept the new key. If you trust the server, type yes to proceed:

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Confirm the authenticity of the server: Before accepting the new key, verify with the server administrator (or the hosting provider) that the fingerprint matches. The fingerprint is:

SHA256:8/WYuQBVj2JvmRdl+9akmuNkARalYEBleqs98JTEfaY

Optional: Edit the known_hosts file manually: If the automated command does not work, you can edit the file manually:

    Open the file in a text editor:

        nano /home/ashraful/.ssh/known_hosts

        Go to line 9 (as indicated in the error) and delete the offending entry.
        Save and exit.

    Retry the connection: Run the SSH command again.

If you're still having issues or suspect unauthorized activity, investigate further before proceeding.

=========================================================================================================
The error "Too many authentication failures" occurs when the SSH client tries multiple keys from your system but fails to authenticate with the server.
Fix the Issue

    Specify the Correct Key: Use the -i option with the SSH command to explicitly provide the correct private key:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@36.255.68.213

Replace id_ed25519 with the appropriate private key file if you're using a different key (e.g., id_rsa).

Limit the Number of Keys Tried: Modify the SSH configuration to limit the number of keys attempted during authentication:

    Open or create the SSH configuration file:

nano ~/.ssh/config

Add the following configuration:

    Host 36.255.68.213
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
        IdentitiesOnly yes

    Replace id_ed25519 with your correct private key file if necessary.

Verify the SSH Agent: If you use an SSH agent (e.g., ssh-agent), ensure it's not trying incorrect keys:

    List the keys currently loaded in the agent:

ssh-add -l

If unwanted keys are loaded, remove them:

ssh-add -d /path/to/unwanted/key

Add the correct key if it’s missing:

    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Retry the Connection: After specifying the correct key, try reconnecting:

ssh root@36.255.68.213

Server-side Configuration (if you have access): If you have administrative access to the server:

    Ensure the SSH server allows enough authentication attempts. Check and modify the MaxAuthTries setting in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

MaxAuthTries 6

Restart the SSH service:

        sudo systemctl restart sshd

If the issue persists, verify that:

    The key being used matches the one added to the server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
    There are no IP blocks or restrictions on the server's firewall.
