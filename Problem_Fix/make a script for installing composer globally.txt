Save this script in a file, for example, install_composer.sh, and then make it executable:

bash

chmod +x install_composer.sh

You can then run the script with:

bash

./install_composer.sh

This script will download and install Composer globally on your system, and add Composer's global binary directory to your PATH so that you can use Composer from any directory.
