The error message means your USB mic **doesn’t support stereo recording** (2 channels). Many headset mics only support **mono** (1 channel).

Let’s fix that by forcing mono input:

---

### ✅ Correct Command for Mono Mic

```bash
arecord -D hw:1,0 -f cd -c1 test-mic.wav
```

Explanation:

* `-c1`: Use **1 channel** (mono)
* `-f cd`: 16-bit, 44100Hz
* `-D hw:1,0`: Your USB mic device

---

### ▶️ Then Play It Back:

```bash
aplay test-mic.wav
```

---

If it works and you hear yourself: 🎉 mic is working fine — just needed correct settings.

#====================== Main Part to show the Microphone Icon ====================================

Perfect — that clarifies everything. Since your **headset connects via USB**, it has its own **separate internal sound card**. Here's what's happening and how to **fully fix it**.

---

### ✅ Summary So Far

* Your USB headset **mic works with ALSA** (`arecord -D hw:1,0`)
* But **PulseAudio can't see the mic**, only sees the monitor (output)
* As a result:

  * ❌ **No mic icon** in the panel
  * ❌ **Browsers can't detect mic**
  * ❌ **Voice apps like Discord, Zoom, Chromium fail**

---

## ✅ Final Fix: Force PulseAudio to load USB mic manually

### 🛠 Step 1: Load the mic into PulseAudio

Run:

```bash
pactl load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0
```

This **forces PulseAudio** to load your USB mic input from ALSA.

---

### 🧪 Step 2: Confirm mic is now visible

Check again:

```bash
pactl list sources short
```

You should now see a line like:

```
2	alsa_input.hw_1_0	module-alsa-source.c	s16le 1ch 44100Hz	RUNNING
```

✅ If you see that, your mic is now usable by:

* Chromium
* Discord
* Zoom
* Any PulseAudio app

---

### 🌐 Step 3: Enable it in Chromium

* Go to `chrome://settings/content/microphone`
* Select input: `alsa_input.hw_1_0`
* Revisit [https://mictests.com](https://mictests.com) → click “Start test”

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Make the fix **permanent** (auto-load mic on boot)

Edit your PulseAudio default config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/pulse
nano ~/.config/pulse/default.pa
```

Add this line at the bottom:

```bash
load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0
```

Now on every boot, PulseAudio will auto-load your USB mic.

---

## ✅ Optional (Mic Icon)

If you'd still like a **mic icon in tray** with volume/mute support:

```bash
sudo apt install pasystray
```

Run it:

```bash
pasystray &
```

Then add it to:

> **Settings → Session and Startup → Application Autostart**

Command: `pasystray`

---

Let me know if `pactl list sources short` shows the mic after the manual module load — that’s the key confirmation it's all fixed.

✅ **Great news!** Your USB headphone **mic is now correctly loaded into PulseAudio** as:

```
2	alsa_input.hw_1_0	module-alsa-source.c	s16le 1ch 44100Hz	SUSPENDED
```

That means:

* ✅ PulseAudio now recognizes your USB microphone
* ✅ You can use it in browsers, Discord, OBS, Zoom, etc.
* 🔇 “SUSPENDED” is normal when the mic isn't actively in use

---

## ✅ Final Steps to Complete the Setup

### 1. 🎙️ Set the mic as **default input**

Run:

```bash
pavucontrol
```

Then:

* Go to **Input Devices**
* Look for: `alsa_input.hw_1_0`
* Click the **green checkmark** ✅ (set as fallback/default)

---

### 2. 🌐 Use in Browser

In Chromium, go to:

```
chrome://settings/content/microphone
```

* Set the default mic to: **`alsa_input.hw_1_0`**
* Reload [https://mictests.com](https://mictests.com) and start test — you should now see **input activity**

---

### 3. 🔁 Make the mic load on every boot

Edit/create the config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/pulse
nano ~/.config/pulse/default.pa
```

Add this at the bottom:

```bash
load-module module-alsa-source device=hw:1,0
```

Save and exit.

Now, on every reboot, the mic will load into PulseAudio automatically.

---

### 4. (Optional) 🧩 Add Mic Icon in Tray

If you want a mic icon:

```bash
sudo apt install pasystray
```

Then run:

```bash
pasystray &
```

To make it auto-start:

* Open **Session and Startup**
* Go to **Application Autostart**
* Add entry:

  * **Name:** Pasystray
  * **Command:** `pasystray`

---

You're done! 🎉 Your mic is now fully integrated into Parrot OS across all applications.

Let me know if you'd like to test in OBS, Zoom, or anything else.
