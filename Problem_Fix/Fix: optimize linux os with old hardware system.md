Got it! Here's a full **English version** to help you make your G41 + Core 2 Duo system faster and smoother, especially for multitasking and video playback.

### üñ•Ô∏è **Your Current System:**

* **Motherboard**: Intel G41
* **CPU**: Core 2 Duo
* **RAM**: 8GB DDR3
* **SSD**: 120GB
* **OS**: Parrot OS

### ‚ùó Issue Summary:

* Laggy video playback
* Slow multitasking
* Overall poor performance

This setup is **very outdated**, especially the Core 2 Duo and G41 chipset (which has weak integrated graphics). Even though Parrot OS is relatively lightweight, it's not ideal for everyday desktop use.

## ‚úÖ How to Make Your PC Faster:

---

### 1. ‚ö° **Switch to a Lightweight OS**

Instead of Parrot OS, use a **lightweight Linux distro** optimized for older hardware:

| OS Name           | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Xubuntu**       | Ubuntu with XFCE desktop       |
| **Linux Lite**    | Very user-friendly, fast       |
| **Zorin OS Lite** | Windows-like, lightweight      |
| **Peppermint OS** | Lightweight & fast             |
| **AntiX**         | Super light, runs on 512MB RAM |
| **Debian XFCE**   | Very stable and light          |

> ‚úÖ These will give you better performance and a smoother experience.

### 2. üéûÔ∏è **Fix VLC Lag (Enable Hardware Acceleration):**

1. Open **VLC**
2. Go to **Tools > Preferences > Input/Codecs**
3. Set **"Hardware-accelerated decoding"** to `Automatic` or `VA-API`
4. Click **Save** and restart VLC

> This will reduce CPU usage during video playback.

---

### 3. üåê **Use Lightweight Browsers**

Avoid Chrome or full Firefox. Use these instead:

| Browser          | Description                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Brave**        | Lightweight and fast               |
| **Midori**       | Ultra lightweight                  |
| **Falkon**       | KDE-based, fast browser            |
| **GNOME Web**    | Very minimal, good for low RAM     |
| **Firefox Lite** | Disable animations, reduce effects |

If using Chromium/Firefox, run with flags:

```bash
chromium --disable-gpu --disable-background-timer-throttling
```

---

### 4. üß† **Optimize RAM & Swap**

* Use `zram` for compressed RAM swap:

```bash
sudo apt install zram-tools
```

* Lower swappiness (use SSD more than RAM swap):

```bash
sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
```

* Clear RAM caches manually:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'
```

---

### 5. üîÅ **Use Lightweight Desktop Environment (DE)**

If you're using GNOME/KDE, switch to:

```bash
sudo apt install xfce4
```

or

```bash
sudo apt install lxde
```

These DEs are very fast and consume low RAM/CPU.

---

### 6. üí° **Disable Unused Services**

Use `htop` or `top` to check for high CPU usage. Disable unnecessary services:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service
sudo systemctl disable cups.service
```

---

### 7. üíΩ **Optimize SSD**

Make sure TRIM is enabled (improves SSD lifespan and speed):

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
```

---

### 8. üì∫ **Play YouTube or Videos via MPV (No browser)**

To avoid lag in browsers:

```bash
sudo apt install mpv youtube-dl
youtube-dl -o - "https://youtube.com/..." | mpv -
```

This uses fewer resources than browser playback.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Optional: Upgrade Suggestion

If possible, consider a low-cost upgrade:

* **Used Core i3 3rd/4th Gen**
* **Cheap H61/H81 motherboard**
* **Keep your current 8GB DDR3 + SSD**

It will **hugely improve performance**, even with Linux.

## üìå Summary Table:

| Task       | Recommendation                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| OS         | Use Xubuntu / Zorin Lite         |
| Video      | Enable VLC hardware acceleration |
| Browser    | Use Brave/Midori/Falkon          |
| Desktop    | Install XFCE or LXDE             |
| RAM        | Enable ZRAM + optimize swap      |
| SSD        | Enable TRIM                      |
| Video      | Use `mpv + youtube-dl`           |
| Background | Disable unused services          |
