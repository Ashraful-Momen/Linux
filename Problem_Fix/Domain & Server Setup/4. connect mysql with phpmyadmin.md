`https://etransfer.cc/phpmyadmin` gives a 404 because **phpMyAdmin is not installed or not configured** on your server yet.

## How to install and configure phpMyAdmin on your Ubuntu VPS with Nginx

---

### 1️⃣ Install phpMyAdmin

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install phpmyadmin php-mbstring php-zip php-gd php-json php-curl -y
```

* During installation, it may ask which web server to configure — **do NOT select Apache** (just press TAB then Enter to skip).

---

### 2️⃣ Enable PHP extensions and restart PHP-FPM

```bash
sudo phpenmod mbstring
sudo systemctl restart php8.1-fpm
```

---

### 3️⃣ Configure Nginx to serve phpMyAdmin

Create a new Nginx config snippet:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/snippets/phpmyadmin.conf
```

Add:

```nginx
location /phpmyadmin {
    root /usr/share/;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
    location ~ ^/phpmyadmin/(.+\.php)$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
        root /usr/share/;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
    location ~* ^/phpmyadmin/(.+\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|png|js|ico|html|xml|txt))$ {
        root /usr/share/;
    }
}
```

---

### 4️⃣ Include this snippet in your main Nginx site config

Edit your Laravel Nginx config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/laravel
```

Inside the `server { }` block, add this line somewhere (e.g., near the other `location` blocks):

```nginx
include snippets/phpmyadmin.conf;
```

---

### 5️⃣ Test and reload Nginx

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

---

### 6️⃣ Access phpMyAdmin

Open in browser:

```
http://etransfer.cc/phpmyadmin
```

---

### 7️⃣ Login with your MariaDB user credentials

Use your MariaDB username and password (e.g., `root` or `laravel_user`).
