Thanks for sharing the output! You're getting this error because:

* `youtube-dl` is **not installed** on your system.
* Since it's missing, `mpv` is just trying to read video data from standard input (`-o -`), but it doesn't receive anything valid — so it fails.

---

## ✅ Let’s fix it step-by-step:

### 1. 🛠️ **Install `yt-dlp` (better than `youtube-dl`)**

> `youtube-dl` is outdated. Use `yt-dlp` – it's a modern, faster fork and works better with YouTube.

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp
```

---

### 2. ▶️ **Play YouTube videos with `yt-dlp` and `mpv`**

Once `yt-dlp` is installed, try this:

```bash
yt-dlp -o - "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" | mpv -
```

> Replace the link with your actual YouTube URL.

This command:

* Downloads the video stream
* Pipes it directly to `mpv` to play without saving

---

### 3. ✅ **If `mpv` is not installed:**

You can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install mpv
```

---

### 4. 📌 Optional: Set it as a script for easy reuse

You can create a simple shell script:

```bash
nano ~/ytplay.sh
```

Paste this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yt-dlp -o - "$1" | mpv -
```

Save and exit. Then run:

```bash
chmod +x ~/ytplay.sh
```

Now you can play any YouTube video with:

```bash
./ytplay.sh "https://youtube.com/..."
```
