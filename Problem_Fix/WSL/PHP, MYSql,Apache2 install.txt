To set up a web development environment with PHP 8.3, MySQL, and Apache2 on your Debian WSL, follow these steps:

### 1. **Update Your Package List**
First, make sure your package list is updated:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### 2. **Install Apache2**
Install Apache2, the web server:

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```

Start and enable Apache2 to run on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```

### 3. **Install MySQL**
Install MySQL server:

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
```

Start and enable MySQL:

```bash
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

### 4. **Secure MySQL Installation**
Run the MySQL secure installation script to set up the root password and secure your MySQL installation:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Follow the prompts to secure your MySQL installation.

### 5. **Install PHP 8.3**
To install PHP 8.3, you'll need to add a third-party repository, as PHP 8.3 might not be available in the default Debian repositories yet.

#### Add the PHP Repository:
First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
```

Then add the `ondrej/php` repository, which provides the latest PHP versions:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
```

#### Install PHP 8.3 and Required Extensions:

```bash
sudo apt install php8.3 php8.3-cli php8.3-common php8.3-mysql libapache2-mod-php8.3 php8.3-xml php8.3-mbstring php8.3-curl php8.3-zip -y
```

### 6. **Configure Apache to Use PHP 8.3**
Ensure that Apache is using the correct PHP version by disabling any older versions and enabling PHP 8.3:

```bash
sudo a2dismod php7.*
sudo a2enmod php8.3
```

Restart Apache to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### 7. **Test Your PHP Installation**
Create a `phpinfo()` file to test your PHP installation:

```bash
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/info.php
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/info.php`. You should see the PHP information page, confirming that PHP 8.3 is correctly installed and working.

### 8. **Optional: Adjust Firewall Settings**
If you need to access your web server from outside your local machine, you may need to adjust the firewall settings:

```bash
sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"
```

### 9. **Start Developing**
Your development environment is now set up with Apache2, MySQL, and PHP 8.3. You can place your web projects in the `/var/www/html/` directory.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) set up on your Debian WSL, ready for web development.
