Thanks for sharing the output! You're getting this error because:

* `youtube-dl` is **not installed** on your system.
* Since it's missing, `mpv` is just trying to read video data from standard input (`-o -`), but it doesn't receive anything valid — so it fails.

---

## ✅ Let’s fix it step-by-step:

### 1. 🛠️ **Install `yt-dlp` (better than `youtube-dl`)**

> `youtube-dl` is outdated. Use `yt-dlp` – it's a modern, faster fork and works better with YouTube.

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yt-dlp
```

---

### 2. ▶️ **Play YouTube videos with `yt-dlp` and `mpv`**

Once `yt-dlp` is installed, try this:

```bash
yt-dlp -o - "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" | mpv -
```

> Replace the link with your actual YouTube URL.

This command:

* Downloads the video stream
* Pipes it directly to `mpv` to play without saving

---

### 3. ✅ **If `mpv` is not installed:**

You can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install mpv
```

---

### 4. 📌 Optional: Set it as a script for easy reuse

You can create a simple shell script:

```bash
nano ~/ytplay.sh
```

Paste this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yt-dlp -o - "$1" | mpv -
```

Save and exit. Then run:

```bash
chmod +x ~/ytplay.sh
```

Now you can play any YouTube video with:

```bash
./ytplay.sh "https://youtube.com/..."
```

Let me know if you face any errors during installation!



====================

Perfect — your `ytplay.sh` looks good! Now let’s turn this script into a **command** (`yplayer`) you can run from anywhere.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step: Make `ytplay.sh` a global command `yplayer`

#### 🔧 1. **Move the script to a system-wide bin folder**

We’ll place it in `/usr/local/bin`, which is in your system’s `$PATH`.

Run:

```bash
sudo cp ytplay.sh /usr/local/bin/yplayer
```

#### 🔧 2. **Make sure it's executable**

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yplayer
```

---

### ✅ Now use it like this:

```bash
yplayer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK351yoTViQ
```

It will instantly stream the video using `yt-dlp` and `mpv`.

---

### 📌 Optional Enhancements (Recommended)

To improve `yplayer` if no URL is passed, edit it like this:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/yplayer
```

Replace content with:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "❗ Usage: yplayer <YouTube-URL>"
    exit 1
fi

yt-dlp -o - "$1" | mpv -
```

Save and exit.

---

You're done ✅

Let me know if you want:

* audio-only mode
* download support
* playlist streaming support

I'll update the script accordingly.
