php 7.4.33 run form my xam now I set the $path= xamp _php .... then can I install the composer with the xampp php7.4.33 without error ?

Yes, you can install Composer using the PHP binary provided by XAMPP (PHP 7.4.33) without any errors.

Here's how you can do it:

    Set the Path to XAMPP PHP: Set the $PATH environment variable to include the directory where XAMPP PHP is located. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc):

    bash

export PATH=/opt/lampp/bin:$PATH

Replace /opt/lampp/bin with the actual path to the directory where XAMPP PHP is located.

Install Composer: After setting the $PATH variable, you can install Composer globally on your system. You can download and install Composer using the following command:

bash

php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"

This command downloads and installs Composer globally using the PHP binary provided by XAMPP.

Verify Composer Installation: After installing Composer, verify that Composer is correctly installed and configured to use XAMPP PHP by running:

bash

    composer --version

    This command should display the Composer version and other information without any errors.

By following these steps, you can install Composer using the PHP binary provided by XAMPP (PHP 7.4.33) without encountering any errors. Once Composer is installed, you can use it to manage dependencies and install Laravel or any other PHP packages as

It seems like there might be a discrepancy between the location where Composer is installed and where your system expects it to be. Even though you've successfully installed Composer locally in your Downloads directory, your system might not be aware of it.

When you run composer -v, your system checks the usual directories where executable binaries are stored (like /usr/local/bin, /usr/bin, etc.). Since Composer isn't found in those directories, it suggests installing it via apt, which would install it system-wide.

To resolve this issue, you have a few options:

    Move Composer to a directory in your PATH: You can move the composer.phar file to a directory that is already in your PATH. /usr/local/bin is a common choice. Once moved, you should be able to run composer from anywhere in your terminal.

    Add Composer's directory to your PATH: Alternatively, you can add the directory containing composer.phar to your PATH variable. This will allow you to execute Composer from any directory without moving the file.

    Create an alias: You can create an alias in your shell configuration file (like .bashrc or .zshrc) to point to the location of composer.phar. This way, you can use a custom command to execute Composer.

For example, you could add this line to your .bashrc or .zshrc file:

bash

alias composer='php /home/shuvo/Downloads/composer.phar'

After saving the file, run source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.zshrc to apply the changes, and then you should be able to use composer command directly.

Any of these methods should resolve the issue and allow you to use Composer without being prompted to install it again.

after install composer then copy the file to => ~/Software/composer/ => ┌──(shuvo㉿kali)-[~/Software/composer]
└─$ ls   
composer.phar

Great, now that you have Composer installed in the ~/Software/composer directory, you can add this directory to your PATH so that you can use Composer from any location in your terminal without specifying the full path each time.

Here's how you can do it:

    Open your shell configuration file (.bashrc, .bash_profile, .zshrc, etc.). You can do this using a text editor like nano, vim, or any other text editor you prefer. For example:

    bash

nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line at the end of the file:

bash

export PATH="$HOME/Software/composer:$PATH"

This line adds the ~/Software/composer directory to the beginning of your PATH, ensuring that your system searches this directory first when looking for executable files.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

To apply the changes, either close and reopen your terminal or run:

bash

source ~/.bashrc

or

bash

    source ~/.zshrc

Now, you should be able to run Composer from any directory without specifying the full path. You can verify this by typing composer -v in your terminal.
