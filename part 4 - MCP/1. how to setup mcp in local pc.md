Got it 👍 You want to **set up an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** in your **Parrot OS** environment so you can use AI-assisted development for your Laravel + DevOps project.

Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for Parrot OS (Debian-based):

---

## 🔹 1. Update your system

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

## 🔹 2. Install prerequisites

You’ll need **Node.js** (>=18), **npm**, and **Python 3.10+** (for some MCP tools).

```bash
# Install Node.js + npm
sudo apt install -y curl git build-essential python3 python3-pip

# Install Node.js 20.x (recommended for MCP)
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

Verify:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
python3 --version
```

---

## 🔹 3. Install MCP server package

OpenAI provides a **reference MCP server**. Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server
```

This will give you the `mcp-server` command.

---

## 🔹 4. Create an MCP server config

Make a directory for your MCP server:

```bash
mkdir ~/mcp-server && cd ~/mcp-server
```

Create a config file `mcp.config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "laravel-devops-ai",
  "description": "MCP server for Laravel + DevOps automation",
  "tools": {
    "bash": {
      "command": "/bin/bash"
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "git"
    },
    "docker": {
      "command": "docker"
    }
  }
}
```

This tells the MCP server it can run **bash, git, docker** commands – perfect for Laravel + DevOps tasks.

---

## 🔹 5. Start MCP server

```bash
mcp-server --config ./mcp.config.json
```

If you want it to run in the background:

```bash
nohup mcp-server --config ./mcp.config.json > server.log 2>&1 &
```

---

## 🔹 6. Connect to your Laravel project

Go to your Laravel project directory:

```bash
cd ~/path/to/your/laravel/project
```

Now, when your AI tool (like VSCode extension, Cursor, or ChatGPT MCP client) connects to the MCP server, it can **directly run git, docker, artisan, composer, and deployment commands** inside your project.

---

## 🔹 7. (Optional) Create Laravel-specific MCP tools

For example, add a `composer` and `artisan` tool in `mcp.config.json`:

```json
"composer": {
  "command": "composer"
},
"artisan": {
  "command": "php artisan"
}
```

Now the AI can run migrations, queue workers, tests, etc.

---

✅ At this point, your MCP server is running on Parrot OS and is ready to integrate with your Laravel + DevOps workflow.

Do you want me to also show you **how to connect your MCP server with ChatGPT / VSCode so the AI can start coding and running DevOps commands inside your Laravel project**?
