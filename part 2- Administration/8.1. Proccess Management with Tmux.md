Here's a clean and **practical explanation** with examples for each of your **process and session management commands**, including `tmux`, `nohup`, and background/foreground process control:

---

# ðŸ”„ **Process Management with `tmux`, `nohup`, and Job Control**

---

## âœ… `tmux` â€” Terminal Multiplexer

### ðŸ”¹ Start a `tmux` session:

```bash
tmux
```

> Creates a new terminal session that is **detached from your current shell**, so you can continue even after disconnection.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Detach from session (leave it running):

```bash
Ctrl + b, then press d
```

> This **detaches** the session and returns you to the normal terminal â€” the session is still running in the background.

---

### ðŸ”¹ List all tmux sessions:

```bash
tmux list-sessions
```

> Shows all running `tmux` sessions with their names and IDs.

**Example output:**

```
0: 1 windows (created Sun Jul 13 10:00:00 2025) [80x24]
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Re-attach to an existing tmux session:

```bash
tmux attach -t 0
```

> Reconnects to session with name/id `0`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Create named session (optional but useful):

```bash
tmux new -s mysession
```

---

## âœ… Job Control: `&`, `fg`, `bg`

### ðŸ”¹ Run process in background:

```bash
ping google.com &
```

> Appends `&` to run the command **in the background**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ List background/paused jobs:

```bash
jobs
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Bring a job back to foreground:

```bash
fg %1
```

> `%1` refers to job number. Use `jobs` to get job number.

---

## âœ… Keep Process Running Even After Logout: `nohup`

### ðŸ”¹ Run a command in background that **survives logout**:

```bash
nohup long_running_script.sh &
```

**Explanation:**

* `nohup`: Prevents process from stopping when terminal closes
* `&`: Puts it in the background
* Output is written to `nohup.out` by default.
