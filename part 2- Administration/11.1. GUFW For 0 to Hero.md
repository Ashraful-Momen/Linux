`gufw` is the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Linux systems like Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, etc. It makes managing firewall rules easier **without terminal commands**.

Here's a full guide to using **GUFW** to set server rules ‚Äî including by IP, port, and more.

---

## üß© 1. üì¶ Install `gufw` (if not already installed)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gufw
```

Launch it from your application menu or with:

```bash
gufw
```

> It will ask for your password (needs root access).

---

## üü¢ 2. üü¢ Enable the Firewall

Once GUFW is open:

* Toggle **‚ÄúStatus‚Äù** to `ON`
* Default policy is usually:

  * **Incoming**: Deny
  * **Outgoing**: Allow

---

## üîß 3. üîß Add Rules in GUFW

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Option 1: Use Preconfigured Rules

* Click **Rules** ‚Üí **+** (Add)
* Choose **Preconfigured**
* Select from common services (e.g., SSH, HTTP, Samba, etc.)

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Option 2: Add Simple Port Rules

Go to:

* **Rules** ‚Üí **+ (Add)**
* Choose **Simple**

  * **Policy**: `Allow`, `Deny`, or `Reject`
  * **Direction**: `Incoming` or `Outgoing`
  * **Port**: e.g., `22`, `80`, `443`
  * **Protocol**: `TCP`, `UDP`, or `Both`

üìå Example:
Allow incoming HTTP:

* Policy: **Allow**
* Direction: **Incoming**
* Port: **80**
* Protocol: **TCP**

---

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Option 3: Add Advanced Rules (by IP, subnet, etc.)

Go to:

* **Rules** ‚Üí **+ (Add)**
* Choose **Advanced**

#### You can set:

| Field         | Example Value         | Meaning                     |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Direction** | Incoming / Outgoing   | Traffic direction           |
| **Policy**    | Allow / Deny / Reject | What to do with the traffic |
| **Interface** | (optional) eth0, etc. | Which NIC to apply rule to  |
| **Protocol**  | TCP / UDP / Any       | Protocol to match           |
| **Port(s)**   | e.g. 22, 80, 3306     | Match specific port(s)      |
| **Address**   | e.g. 192.168.1.10     | Match specific IP or subnet |

üìå Example: Allow SSH only from specific IP:

* Direction: **Incoming**
* Policy: **Allow**
* Protocol: **TCP**
* Port: `22`
* Address: `203.0.113.25`

## üîê 4. Example Use Cases

| Task                           | Rule (Advanced)                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Allow HTTP (port 80)           | Allow TCP 80                        |
| Deny FTP (port 21)             | Deny TCP 21                         |
| Allow MySQL only from IP       | Allow TCP 3306 from `192.168.1.100` |
| Block a specific IP completely | Deny Any from `203.0.113.15`        |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è 5. Apply and Review

* Your rules take effect immediately.
* You can toggle individual rules on/off with checkboxes.
* You can sort and delete rules.

---

## üß† Extra Tips

* **Be careful when disabling SSH access** ‚Äî you may lock yourself out of a remote server.
* Use `gufw` only when a desktop GUI is available. On headless servers, stick to `ufw` CLI.

---

## üß™ CLI Equivalent for Reference

E.g., what GUFW does under the hood:

```bash
sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.25 to any port 22 proto tcp
sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.15
```
