# Redirection is a method to save or append content into a file.
#suppose if useri file inside content is 1,2,3 and user2 conent is 4,5,6 and we want to save it to new file all_user:
>>>> cat user1 user2 > all_user
# if we want to append user3 inside content is : 7,8,9
>>> cat user3 >> all_user
so we have to use ">>" sign for append

# show the total number of content: 


>>> cat -n all_user

-------------------------------------------------------
'<' this sign is user for , if some command written inside the file then execute the command from a file ....


================================================================================================
In Linux, the `<` symbol is used for **input redirection**. It tells the shell to take the input for a command **from a file** instead of from the keyboard (standard input).


Now you want to pass this file as input to the `sort` command (which sorts lines alphabetically).

```bash
sort < input.txt
```

**Output:**
```
hello
world
```

If the file contained:
```
world
hello
```

Then `sort < input.txt` would output:
```
hello
world
```

### 📝 Another Example: Executing Commands from a File

If a file contains **actual shell commands**, you can pass it to a shell like this:

Suppose `commands.sh` contains:
```bash
echo "This is a test"
ls
```

You can run:
```bash
bash < commands.sh
```

This feeds the contents of `commands.sh` into the `bash` shell to execute the commands.
