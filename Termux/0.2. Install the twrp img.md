### Step to Boot TWRP Temporarily (without flashing yet)

1. Make sure your phone is **in Fastboot mode** (powered off → hold **Volume Down + Power** until fastboot screen appears).

2. Connect phone to PC via USB.

3. Open terminal on your Parrot OS, navigate to the folder where your `twrp.img` is stored.

4. Run this command to **boot TWRP temporarily** (does not overwrite recovery partition yet):

```bash
fastboot boot twrp.img
```

* Your phone will boot directly into **TWRP recovery** after this command.

---

### Why temporary boot first?

* It prevents the stock ROM from **overwriting TWRP** recovery on reboot.
* You get to verify TWRP works before flashing it permanently.

---

### After TWRP boots successfully:

* You can then **flash TWRP permanently** from inside TWRP itself (via "Install Image" → select recovery partition → flash `twrp.img`).

---

fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
fastboot reboot
# Immediately hold Volume Up + Power on phone to boot recovery


---
#caution :
-------------
Download the correct image file and copy the file into the same folder as your platform-tools as well as device’s storage. Rename the image to twrp.img.

Now reboot to fastboot/download/bootloader mode by using adb or manual key combos (Use Google to find that if you are not sure). To use adb to reboot, use the following command:

adb reboot bootloader

Temporary boot the downloaded image using the following command:

fastboot boot twrp.img

Preferred Installation Method: Once booted, navigate to the Advanced > Flash Current TWRP option. This will install the TWRP image you just booted permanently to the device.

Alternate Installation Method: Once booted, navigate to the Advanced > Install Recovery Ramdisk option. This will ask you to select the image you want to install TWRP from. Select the TWRP image you just downloaded and copied into device storage. Proceed to install this image.

NOTE: You also need to use the “Fix Recovery Bootloop” option present in the same Advanced Tab. Use that option after you have installed the recovery ramdisk successfully to avoid boot loops happening from installing TWRP Permanently.
