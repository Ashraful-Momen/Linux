  > **Xiaomi Mi A3 – LineageOS 22 – NetHunter Rooted**

### 🧰 Step 2: Temporarily Boot into TWRP

Use the same method you trust:

```bash
fastboot boot twrp.img
```

> **Don’t flash TWRP permanently.** Just boot it temporarily.

---

### 🧪 Step 3: Flash Kali NetHunter ZIP

Once in TWRP:

1. **Transfer** `nethunter-mi_a3.zip` to `/sdcard/`

   ```bash
   adb push nethunter-mi_a3.zip /sdcard/
   ```
2. **In TWRP:**

   * Tap `Install`
   * Select `nethunter-mi_a3.zip`
   * Swipe to flash
3. Reboot to system

---

### ✅ Step 4: Set Up Kali NetHunter

1. Install NetHunter App (if not auto-installed):

   ```bash
   adb install NetHunter.apk
   ```
2. Open the app → Grant **Magisk root** access
3. Use:

   * `NetHunter Terminal`
   * `Kali chroot`
   * Tools like `airmon-ng`, `hydra`, `nmap`, etc.

## 💥 Bonus: You Now Have Full Kali on Real Rooted Kernel

Unlike rootless installs, this version allows:

✅ WiFi monitor mode (if kernel supports it)
✅ HID attacks
✅ USB attacks
✅ Full terminal access with root
✅ Support for Metasploit, Nmap, Sqlmap, etc.
