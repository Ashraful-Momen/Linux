Great! Let‚Äôs address both of these messages:

---

## **1. lynx: not found (apachectl status warning)**

* **Cause**: Apache tries to display status using the **lynx** terminal browser.
* **Solution** (Optional, not critical):

  ```bash
  pkg install lynx -y
  ```

  ‚ÄîOR‚Äî
  Just ignore this warning if you don‚Äôt need a terminal browser view for status.

---

## **2. ServerName Directive Warning**

* **Cause**: Apache doesn't have a **ServerName** defined in the config file.
* **Solution**:

  1. Open Apache config file:

     ```bash
     nano /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/etc/apache2/httpd.conf
     ```

  2. Add this line at the **end of the file** (or uncomment if exists):

     ```
     ServerName localhost
     ```

  3. Save and Exit (Ctrl + X, Y, Enter).

  4. Restart Apache:

     ```bash
     apachectl restart
     ```

## **3. About the ‚Äú127.0.0.1‚Äù Binding Warning**

That‚Äôs not an error, it's just a **hostname warning**, the server will still work fine.

## **Test if Apache is Running:**

* Open your browser on the phone and go to:

  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  ```
* Or from another device in the same WiFi network:

  ```bash
  ifconfig  # Get IP Address (like 192.168.x.x)
  ```

  Then access:

  ```
  http://<Your-Phone-IP>:8080
  ```

## **Verify Web Page Hosting:**

1. Go to Apache web root:

   ```bash
   cd /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/share/apache2/default-site/htdocs
   ```
2. Add HTML file:

   ```bash
   echo "<h1>Hello Termux Apache Server!</h1>" > index.html
   ```
3. Restart Apache:

   ```bash
   apachectl restart
   ```

---

## **If Page Still Doesn‚Äôt Load Externally?**

* Ensure your phone is on the **same network (WiFi)**.
* Some Android versions block incoming requests. You may need:

  * **Port forwarding with Ngrok** *(no root)*.
  * **Iptables rules** *(root required)*.

---

## Do you want me to give you:

1. **PHP Installation on Apache2 in Termux**?
2. **Ngrok setup to access from anywhere (no root)?**

Let me know! üî•
